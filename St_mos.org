	23 Awake, Lord! Why do you sleep?\\
    	   Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever.\\
	24 Why do you hide your face\\
    	   and forget our misery and oppression?\\
	25 We are brought down to the dust;\\
    	   our bodies cling to the ground.\\
	26 Rise up and help us;\\
    	   rescue us because of your unfailing love.\\
